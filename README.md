- 💻 Vanilla JavaScript for game logic
- 🎭 CSS for styling
- 📱 Responsive design principles

### Key Features
- ⚡ Smooth, lag-free gameplay
- 🎮 Intuitive controls
- 🌟 Collision detection system
- 🎨 Clean visual design
- 🔄 Efficient game loop
- 📱 Cross-browser compatibility

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Any modern web browser
- Basic understanding of HTML/JavaScript (for development)
- Local development server (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/platform-game.git
```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**
```bash
cd platform-game
```

3. **Launch the Game**
- Option 1: Open `index.html` directly in a browser
- Option 2: Use a local development server
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve
```

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ← | Move Left |
| → | Move Right |
| ↑ | Jump |
| Space | Action (Future Use) |

### Game Rules
- Jump between platforms to explore
- Avoid falling off the screen
- Master the momentum and physics

## 🏗 Game Architecture

### Core Components

#### Game Loop System
```javascript
function gameLoop() {
    update();
    draw();
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}
```

#### Physics Engine
- Gravity simulation
- Velocity-based movement
- Collision detection
- Jump mechanics
